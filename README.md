# Heart-stroke-prediction
This is a machine learning minor project for predicting heart stroke using the classification technique. The ML model correctly predicts a heart stroke with 95% accuracy. 
The dataset used have been taken from Kaggle datasets. It is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
The ML model was trained using Support vector machines and Logistics regression  techniques.
